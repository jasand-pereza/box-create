box-create
==========

An experimental ui that allows the creation of web elements. This was originally created for use in rapid prototyping of responsive website pages using the Foundation 3 framework.
DOM elements can be created on the spot or existing snippets can be dragged onto the grid. 

Since this is a work in progress, there are a number bugs that still need to fixed.
